GitBook Spoiler Plugin
===

This is a plugin for making text that are only visible when the cursor is above it, similar to the spoiler tag on Reddit. See the plugin at work here: [Click here](http://ymcatar.gitbooks.io/gitbook-test/content/testing_spoiler.html)

## Usage

Put the text that you want to hide within ```{%s%}``` and ```{%ends%}```, for example:

```
This is a spoiler: {%s%}Hello World.{%ends%}
```
